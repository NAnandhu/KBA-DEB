            <td>Bca</td>HTTP Methods:

            GET: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., get a list of users).
            POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource (e.g., create a new blog post).
            PUT: Update an existing resource (e.g., edit a user profile).
            DELETE: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a comment).
            Stateless: Each request must contain all the necessary information for the server to process it. No session state is stored on the server between requests.
            
            Resources: Everything in a REST API is considered a resource, such as users, posts, images, etc. Resources are usually represented in a format like JSON or XML.
            
            Endpoints: Specific URLs where the API can be accessed. They are often structured to represent resources:
            
            /users (GET: retrieves users, POST: creates new user)
            /users/{id} (GET: retrieves user by ID, PUT: updates user by ID, DELETE: deletes user by ID)
            Status Codes: REST APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:
            
            200 OK: Request was successful.
