            <p> <span class="text">Block Chain </span> A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital
                ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered
                retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.
                Business runs on information. The faster information is received and the more accurate it is, the
                better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared, and
                observable information that is stored on an immutable ledger that only permissioned network members can
                access. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because
                members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving
                you greater confidence, and new efficiencies and opportunities.

            <p> <span class="text">Artificial intelligence (AI)</span>, in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited
                by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops
                and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and
                intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines
                may be called AIs.</p>

            <p><span class="text">Web design </span>encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
            production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user
            interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user
            experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams
            covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term
            "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design
            of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of
            web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web
            accessibility guidelines.
